# GithubProfile



## 📝 Description

GithubProfile is a project designed to showcase your GitHub profile in a visually appealing and informative way. Using a combination of modern web technologies, this project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of your contributions, repositories, and activity on GitHub. The project leverages the GitHub API to dynamically fetch and display your profile information. While the current tech stack is not explicitly defined, the project's functionality suggests the use of technologies such as JavaScript for interacting with the GitHub API, HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the user interface, and potentially a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for building a dynamic and interactive user experience. Key features include displaying your profile information, listing your repositories, and showing your recent GitHub activity.
